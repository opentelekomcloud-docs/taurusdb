Overview
========

TaurusDB is a MySQL-compatible, enterprise-grade distributed database service. It decouples compute from storage and supports up to 128 TB of storage per instance. With TaurusDB, there is no need to deal with sharding, and no need to worry about data loss. It provides the high availability and superior performance of commercial databases at the price of open-source databases.

.. note::

   Data Function Virtualization (DFV) is a high-performance and high-reliability distributed storage system that is vertically integrated with databases. Storage clusters are deployed in pools to improve storage utilization.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on DB instances. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <gaussdb_02_0000>`.

If you plan to access TaurusDB through an API, ensure that you are familiar with TaurusDB concepts. For details, see `Introduction <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/gaussdb-mysql/umn/introduction/index.html>`__ in *TaurusDB User Guide*.
