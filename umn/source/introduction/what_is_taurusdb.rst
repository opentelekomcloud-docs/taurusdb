What Is TaurusDB?
=================

TaurusDB is an enterprise-grade distributed database fully compatible with MySQL. It decouples compute from storage and supports up to 128 TB of storage per instance. With TaurusDB, there is no need to deal with sharding, and no need to worry about data loss. It provides the high availability and superior performance of commercial databases at the price of open-source databases.

A TaurusDB instance consists of one primary node (write node) and multiple read replicas (read-only nodes). They share the underlying DFV storage.

:ref:`DB Engines and Versions <gaussdb_01_0005>` lists the versions supported by TaurusDB.
