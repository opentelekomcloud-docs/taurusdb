Working with Backups
====================

TaurusDB supports backups and restorations to ensure data reliability.

Automated Backups
-----------------

Automated backups are created during the backup time window configured for your instances. TaurusDB saves automated backups based on a retention period you specify. If necessary, you can restore to any point in time during your backup retention period.

Manual Backups
--------------

Manual backups are user-initiated full backups of DB instances. They are retained until you delete them manually.
